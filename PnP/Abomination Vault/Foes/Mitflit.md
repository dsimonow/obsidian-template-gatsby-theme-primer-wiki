**Vengeful Anger** (emotion, mental) As long as it isn’t frightened, a mitflit gains a +2 status bonus to damage rolls against a creature that has previously damaged or tormented it.

Mitflits, also known as mites, are self-loathing and pitiful cowards, easily bullied into servitude by other creatures or even slightly more powerful mitflit leaders. They tame insects, spiders, and other such creatures to serve as faithful allies. Mitflits have lost most of their ancestral gremlin magic, leaving these incomplete beings full of doubt and insecurity. Mitflits find companionship in the other base creatures of the world, and forge bonds of friendship with vermin, the only other beings that seem willing to accept them. A social structure, even one in which they are bullied, partially fills the hole within mitflits’ personalities, and they rarely rebel or rail out unless their rage hits a breaking point.
