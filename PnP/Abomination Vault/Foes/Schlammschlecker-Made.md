**Gnaw Flesh** **Requirement** The giant maggot has Grabbed a creature; **Effect** The giant maggot deals 1d8+2 slashing damage to the grabbed creature as it chews the creature’s flesh (DC 19 basic Reflex save).

**Requirements** The monster’s last action was a success with a Strike that lists Grab in its damage entry, or it has a creature grabbed using this action. **Effect** The monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the monster’s next turn. The creature is grabbed by whichever body part the monster attacked with, and that body part can’t be used to Strike creatures until the grab is ended.  
Using Grab extends the duration of the monster’s Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it. A grabbed creature can use the Escape action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the monster moves away from it.

Giant flies lay their eggs on the bodies of larger monsters or livestock. When they hatch, these eggs release squirming maggots the size of human children, ravenous young who voraciously consume any flesh in the immediate vicinity—typically starting with the body upon which they were born.
