**Belly Grease** >> The slurk extrudes a slippery grease from its ventral glands to coat the floor under it and in a 5-foot emanation, turning the affected area into uneven ground for 10 minutes, after which it dries to a putrid crust. The DC to Balance across the slime is 18.

**Entangling Slime** A creature struck by a slurk’s slime squirt becomes clumsy 1 and takes a –5\-foot penalty to Speed for 1 hour or until the slime is removed. The slime can be removed with a total of three Interact actions by the entangled creature or creatures adjacent to the creature. These actions don’t need to be consecutive or made by the same creature.
