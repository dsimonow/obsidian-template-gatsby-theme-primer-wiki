**Draft Contract** (conjuration, divine, manipulate) Urevian produces an infernal contract for a single living mortal. This contract can grant a wide range of abilities and effects, akin to the power of a [wish](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=11354&name=urevian#!) spell but fulfilled to the letter by Urevian. To receive any of those benefits, the mortal must willingly sign its true name to the contract. At that point, the mortal’s soul is bound to Urevian and to Hell.

While the contract is in effect, the mortal can’t be restored to life except by [wish](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=11354&name=urevian#!) or similar magic. If the mortal is restored to life by those means, Urevian knows which mortal came to life and can locate the creature or creatures who restored the mortal to life for 1 year, gaining the effects of a [locate](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=11354&name=urevian#!) spell with unlimited range. Avoiding the terms of an infernal contract is difficult and often dangerous.

**Infernal Wound** (divine, necromancy) Urevian’s Strikes also deal 2d6 persistent bleed damage that resists attempts to heal them. The flat check to stop the bleeding starts at DC 20. The DC is reduced to 15 only if the bleeding creature or an ally successfully assists with the recovery. The DC to Administer First Aid to a creature with an infernal wound is increased by 5. A spellcaster or item attempting to use healing magic on a creature suffering from an infernal wound must succeed at a DC 28 counteract check or the magic fails to heal the creature.

**Right of Inspection** Urevian can cast his innate [scrying](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=11354&name=urevian#!) spell at will, but only to target a creature with which he has a contract, a specific creature named in a contract he has, or a descendant of any of those creatures. The outcome of the target’s saving throw is one step worse than the result it rolled.****
