When the monster Strikes a creature that has the flat-footed condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, it also deals the listed precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown weapon, that weapon must also be an agile or finesse weapon. Carman deals an extra 2d6 precision damage to flat-footed creatures.

**Sudden Throw** (flourish) Carman quickly draws a thrown weapon and makes a ranged Strike with it. His target must succeed at a DC 22 Perception check or be caught flat-footed by the attack.
**Surprise Attacker** On the first round of combat, creatures that haven’t acted yet are flat-footed to Carman.
