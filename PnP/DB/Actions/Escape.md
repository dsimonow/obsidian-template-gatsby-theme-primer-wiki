___

You attempt to escape from being [grabbed](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=20), [immobilized](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=24), or [restrained](https://2e.aonprd.com/Conditions.aspx?ID=33). Choose one creature, object, spell effect, hazard, or other impediment imposing any of those conditions on you. Attempt a check using your unarmed attack modifier against the DC of the effect. This is typically the [Athletics](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=3) DC of a creature grabbing you, the [Thievery](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=17) DC of a creature who tied you up, the spell DC for a spell effect, or the listed Escape DC of an object, hazard, or other impediment. You can attempt an [Acrobatics](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=1) or Athletics check instead of using your attack modifier if you choose (but this action still has the [attack](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=15) trait).
