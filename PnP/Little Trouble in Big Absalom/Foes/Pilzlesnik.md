**Verdant Burst** (healing) When a fungus leshy dies, a burst of primal energy explodes from its body, restoring 2d8 Hit Points to each fungi creature in a 30-foot emanation. This area is filled with fungi, becoming difficult terrain. If the terrain is not a viable environment for these trees, they wither after 24 hours.

The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use [Change Shape](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) to appear as a specific individual. Using [Change Shape](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) counts as creating a disguise for the [Impersonate](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) use of Deception. The monster’s transformation automatically defeats [Perception](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) [DCs](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. [Change Shape](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn’t gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and [Strikes](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!), and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block. (concentrate, polymorph, primal, transmutation) The [leaf leshy](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) transforms into a giant mushroom or patch of fungi. This ability otherwise uses the effects of [tree shape](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!).

**Spore Cloud** (poison) A fungus leshy can unleash a cloud of spores that irritates the eyes and throats of non-fungi creatures in a 15-foot emanation. Each creature must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save or take 1 persistent poison damage. A creature has its vision reduced as long as the persistent damage continues and can see only within 20 feet (or 10 feet, on a critical failure).

**Spores** A creature that takes damage from a fungus leshy’s spore pod [Strike](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) must attempt a saving throw with the same DC and effect as its [Spore Cloud](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=3530&name=flash_beetle#!) ability.

Fungus leshys guard caves, bogs, and damp, dark places. Their fungus gardens are bizarre by most standards, but fungus leshys are extremely proud of their works.
