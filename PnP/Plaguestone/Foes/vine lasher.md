**Light Hold** A creature grabbed by a vine lasher is not immobilized, but the grabbed creature’s space and every adjacent square use the rules for difficult [[Terrain]]. If the creature moves, the vine lasher moves with it, always keeping the grabbed creature within 10 feet of itself. If two or more vine lashers have a creature grabbed in this way, then the target’s space and adjacent square instead use the rules for greater difficult terrain.

**Requirements** The monster’s last action was a success with a [Strike](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=4153&name=vine_lasher#!) that lists Grab in its damage entry, or it has a creature grabbed using this action. **Effect** The monster automatically Grabs the target until the end of the monster’s next turn. The creature is grabbed by whichever body part the monster attacked with, and that body part can’t be used to [Strike](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=4153&name=vine_lasher#!) creatures until the grab is ended.  
Using Grab extends the duration of the monster’s Grab until the end of its next turn for all creatures grabbed by it. A grabbed creature can use the [Escape](https://pf2easy.com/index.php?id=4153&name=vine_lasher#!) action to get out of the grab, and the Grab ends for a grabbed creatures if the monster moves away from it.
